The folder called 'functions' contains the main functions to perform the proposed omnibus test, and some auxiliary functions and packages needed to run the code in this repository. Run the scripts in that folder first.

The folder called 'simulations' contains the code related to the simulation study considered in the paper. Scenarios 1 to 4 refer to the null hypothesis, while Scenarios 5 and 6 refer to the alternative hypothesis. For each one of the Scenarios 5 and 6, there are 4 different scripts, each one referring to a different noise distribution, Gaussian (default), Student-t (t), Brownian motion (bm) and Brownian motion with outliers (contaminated).

The folder called 'application' contains the data and the code related to the application considered in the paper.
